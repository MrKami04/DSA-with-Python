# DSA-with-Python
Here i will share notes and codes about python programming basics and data structure and algorithms.

what is efficiency of programming?? Ans: how much take time and space of code.
-->> google use algorithm pagerank.??
--> time and input graph

-->measuring time of programs techniques are:
--> 01: measuring time to execute (but this method company not follow becuase a lot of disadvantages)
--> 02: counting operation involved
--> 03: abstract notion of order of growth{order of growth is best for measuring time of program(what do we want:--> 001: we want ot evaluate the algorithms, -->> 002: we want ot evaliuate scaleability, -->> 003: we want to evaluate in terms of input size)}
